This is an adventure game where you travel from room to room until you make it out and into the different areas. You can pick up items, make choices
and even improve stats to a degree. The point of the game is to adventure through the quest line. This is meant to demonstrate my skills in python, and to show creativity.


improvements to be made:
-when you pick up an item, it still shows the item available to pick up
-some items are listed that are not able to be picked up 
-need to develop a storyline to play through
-later would like to add in some graphics
-need an option to exit the game.
